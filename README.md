Spacestagram: Image-sharing from the final frontier for the Shopify Front End Developer Intern Challenge 2022

# User Story
This app allows the user to search through NASA's APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day) Api and like or dislike images.
I really enjoyed creating this project, I have had a bit of experience using React and it was interesting to revisit. I have never used a NASA api before, but I enjoyed working with it for this project.
